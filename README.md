## Changes

Here is what I did differently onmy second take

- Removed the `article` element from thepage after I was toldit was being used incorrectly.
- Changed my `h1` headings to `h2` as it can be reused.
- Added a visually hidden `h1` title so I don't get accessibility warnings.
- Changed my `<button class="btn">` to `<a href="#" class="btn">` as these buttons are supposed to be directing viewers to a different part of the site.
- I changed the `px` value in my `@media` to `em` for imroved accessibility.

## Acknowledgements

This is the part where I would like to thank [@vcarames](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/vcarames) for all the suggested changes to improve my coding.
